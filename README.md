# Monte Carlo Batch Normalization

This repository contains a Pytorch implementation of Monte Carlo Batch Normalization method for a Bayesian approximation of a Neural Network, introduced in [Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06455).
In mcbn.py, funtions to set the MCBN mode during inference are defined, together with a class to utilize the method as an ensemble method.
To see a TensorFlow implementation, visit the [original code repository](https://github.com/icml-mcbn/mcbn).

## Usage example

Examples using the method can be found in the example_notebook.ipynb
